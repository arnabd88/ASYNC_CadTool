Data structure for storing the Transitions and Places correspondence

Dict1:
---------
keys                 Values
~~~~~               ~~~~~~~~
Transitions   ->   {Places or Places-Transition pairs}

Dict2:
---------
Keys
~~~~~
Places       ->    {Connecting transitions]




1. Read-in the lpn
2. Get the inputs and outputs in serial order <I/0>
3. Find the point saying '.graph'. That is where the STG begins
4. We are bulding untimed versions, hence strip off the timing bounds( identified by first '#')
5. Split using space.
6. The first argument is going to be the enabled transition
7. Identify if the following arguments are transitions or implied places.
8.
